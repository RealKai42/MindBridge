| 4503 | Human activity is driving a "catastrophic" loss of species, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The Living Planet Report reveals that global wildlife populations have decreased by an average of 73% over the past 50 years. This decline affects various species, from elephants in tropical forests to hawksbill turtles near the Great Barrier Reef. The loss of wild spaces is pushing many ecosystems to the brink, with habitats like the Amazon and coral reefs nearing dangerous tipping points. The report, based on the Living Planet Index, highlights that 60% of Amazon pink river dolphins have been lost due to pollution, mining, and civil unrest. Despite some conservation successes, such as a 3% annual increase in a sub-population of mountain gorillas in East Africa, these isolated victories are insufficient against widespread habitat destruction. The report identifies habitat degradation, overexploitation, invasive species, disease, climate change, and pollution as major threats to wildlife. WWF chief scientific adviser Mike Barrett emphasizes that human actions, particularly food production and consumption, are accelerating habitat loss. The report warns that nature loss and climate change are pushing the world towards irreversible tipping points, including the potential collapse of the Amazon rainforest. Urgent, collective action from world leaders is needed to reverse this trend. |

| 4503 | 651 | Human activity is continuing to drive what conservation charity the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) calls a "catastrophic" loss of species. The report is based on the Living Planet Index of more than 5,000 bird, mammal, amphibian, reptile, and fish population counts over five decades. Insect declines, for example, allow us to piece together a robust and worrying picture of global biodiversity collapse. Hawksbill turtles are in decline, with nesting females in north-east Queensland, Australia, falling by 57% over 28 years. The report also measures declines in bird species such as chinstrap penguins in Antarctica. |

| 4503 | 651 | The article discusses the alarming decline in global biodiversity, driven primarily by human activities. According to a report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), there has been a "catastrophic" loss of species, as evidenced by the Living Planet Index. This index tracks over 5,000 populations of birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and fish over the past fifty years. The data reveals significant declines in various species, including insects, which contribute to a broader, troubling picture of global biodiversity collapse. Specific examples highlighted in the report include the Hawksbill turtle, whose nesting female population in north-east Queensland, Australia, has decreased by 57% over 28 years. Additionally, bird species such as chinstrap penguins in Antarctica are also experiencing significant declines. The report underscores the urgent need for conservation efforts to address the ongoing loss of species and protect global biodiversity. |

| 4503 | 651 | Human activity is driving a "catastrophic" loss of species, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The Living Planet Index, which tracks over 5,000 populations of birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and fish, shows a 68% average decline in vertebrate species from 1970 to 2020. This decline is due to habitat destruction, pollution, overfishing, and climate change, which not only harm wildlife but also threaten ecosystems essential for human survival. Insects, crucial for pollination and decomposition, are also declining, leading to further ecosystem disruptions.<br><br>Specific species are highlighted, such as the Hawksbill turtle, which has seen a 57% decline in nesting females in north-east Queensland, Australia, due to illegal poaching and habitat loss. Chinstrap penguins in Antarctica are declining due to changes in sea ice and prey availability linked to climate change. African elephants face dramatic population declines from poaching and habitat fragmentation, while the vaquita porpoise is near extinction due to bycatch in illegal fishing nets.<br><br>The WWF calls for immediate global action, including stronger wildlife protection laws, more protected areas, sustainable land and water management, and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Individual actions, such as reducing plastic use and supporting sustainable products, are also crucial. The report emphasizes the urgent need to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to ensure a sustainable future. |
