In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. Of course when she had left her house she'd had slippers on, but what good had they been? They were very big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother. The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast. One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own. And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand. No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent.\n\nShivering with cold and hunger, she crept along, a picture of misery, poor little girl! The snowflakes fell on her long fair hair, which hung in pretty curls over her neck. In all the windows lights were shining, and there was a wonderful smell of roast goose, for it was New Year's eve. Yes, she thought of that!\n\nIn a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected farther out into the street than the other, she sat down and drew up her little feet under her. She was getting colder and colder, but did not dare to go home, for she had sold no matches, nor earned a single cent, and her father would surely beat her. Besides, it was cold at home, for they had nothing over them but a roof through which the wind whistled even though the biggest cracks had been stuffed with straw and rags.\n\nHer hands were almost dead with cold. Oh, how much one little match might warm her! If she could only take one from the box and rub it against the wall and warm her hands. She drew one out. R-r-ratch! How it sputtered and burned! It made a warm, bright flame, like a little candle, as she held her hands over it; but it gave a strange light! It really seemed to the little girl as if she were sitting before a great iron stove with shining brass knobs and a brass cover. How wonderfully the fire burned! How comfortable it was! The youngster stretched out her feet to warm them too; then the little flame went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the burnt match in her hand.\n\nShe struck another match against the wall. It burned brightly, and when the light fell upon the wall it became transparent like a thin veil, and she could see through it into a room. On the table a snow-white cloth was spread, and on it stood a shining dinner service. The roast goose steamed gloriously, stuffed with apples and prunes. And what was still better, the goose jumped down from the dish and waddled along the floor with a knife and fork in its breast, right over to the little girl. Then the match went out, and she could see only the thick, cold wall. She lighted another match. Then she was sitting under the most beautiful Christmas tree. It was much larger and much more beautiful than the one she had seen last Christmas through the glass door at the rich merchant's home. Thousands of candles burned on the green branches, and colored pictures like those in the printshops looked down at her. The little girl reached both her hands toward them. Then the match went out. But the Christmas lights mounted higher. She saw them now as bright stars in the sky. One of them fell down, forming a long line of fire.\n\n\"Now someone is dying,\" thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star fell down a soul went up to God.\n\nShe rubbed another match against the wall. It became bright again, and in the glow the old grandmother stood clear and shining, kind and lovely.\n\n\"Grandmother!\" cried the child. \"Oh, take me with you! I know you will disappear when the match is burned out. You will vanish like the warm stove, the wonderful roast goose and the beautiful big Christmas tree!\"\n\nAnd she quickly struck the whole bundle of matches, for she wished to keep her grandmother with her. And the matches burned with such a glow that it became brighter than daylight. Grandmother had never been so grand and beautiful. She took the little girl in her arms, and both of them flew in brightness and joy above the earth, very, very high, and up there was neither cold, nor hunger, nor fear-they were with God.\n\nBut in the corner, leaning against the wall, sat the little girl with red cheeks and smiling mouth, frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. The New Year's sun rose upon a little pathetic figure. The child sat there, stiff and cold, holding the matches, of which one bundle was almost burned.\n\n\"She wanted to warm herself,\" the people said. No one imagined what beautiful things she had seen, and how happily she had gone with her old grandmother into the bright New Year.",

In the cold and gloom, a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. She had been out all day, trying to sell matches, but no one had bought any, and now she had not a single penny to take home. She was shivering with cold and hunger, a picture of misery, poor little girl! The snowflakes fell on her long fair hair, which hung in pretty curls over her neck. In all the windows, lights were beginning to twinkle, and the smell of roast goose wafted through the air, reminding her of the warmth and comfort she lacked.\n\nShe found a corner between two houses, one of which projected further out into the street than the other, and she sat down there, huddling her little feet under her. But she grew colder and colder, and she dared not go home, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a single penny. Her father would surely beat her, and besides, it was almost as cold at home as it was here. They had only the roof above them, and the wind whistled through the cracks, though they had stuffed them with straw and rags.\n\nHer little hands were almost numb with cold. Ah! Perhaps a burning match might be some good, if she could draw one from the bundle and strike it against the wall, just to warm her fingers. She drew one out. R-r-ratch! How it sputtered and burned! It made a warm, bright flame, like a little candle, as she held her hands over it; but it gave a strange light! It really seemed to the little girl as though she were sitting before a large iron stove with polished brass feet and a brass ornament. How the fire burned! It seemed so beautifully warm that the child stretched out her feet to warm them too. But the small flame went out, the stove vanished, and she had only the remains of the burnt match in her hand.\n\nShe struck another match against the wall. It burned brightly, and where the light fell upon the wall, it became transparent like a veil, and she could see into the room. A snow-white cloth was spread upon the table, on which stood a shining dinner service, and a steaming roast goose stuffed with apples and prunes. And what was still better, the goose jumped down from the dish and waddled along the floor with a knife and fork in its breast, right over to the little girl. Then the match went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, cold wall before her.\n\nShe lit another match. Now she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree. It was larger and more beautifully decorated than the one she had seen through the glass door at the rich merchant's house. Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop windows, looked down upon her. The little girl stretched out her hands towards them, but the match went out. The Christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked like the stars in the sky. Then she saw a star fall, leaving behind it a bright streak of fire.\n\n\"Someone is dying,\" thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.\n\nShe rubbed another match against the wall. It became bright again, and in the glow, the old grandmother stood clear and shining, kind and lovely.\n\n\"Grandmother,\" cried the little one, \"oh, take me with you! I know you will go away when the match burns out. You will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas tree.\"\n\nAnd she hastily struck all the matches in the bundle, for she wished to keep her grandmother with her as long as possible. The matches flared up with such a blaze that it was brighter than daylight. Never before had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little girl in her arms, and both of them flew in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold, nor hunger, nor pain, for they were with God.\n\nIn the cold morning light, the poor little girl sat there, in the corner between the houses, with rosy cheeks and a smiling mouth—frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. The New Year's sun rose upon a little lifeless body, still holding the matches, of which one bundle was burnt.\n\n\"She wanted to warm herself,\" the people said. No one imagined what beautiful things she had seen, nor into what glory she had entered with her grandmother, on that New Year's Eve.",
    "summary": "It was a bitterly cold evening, the last of the year, and a poor little girl, barefoot and bareheaded, wandered the streets trying to sell matches. Despite her efforts, she hadn't sold any and was shivering with cold and hunger. She found a corner between two houses to sit and huddle for warmth, but she grew colder and dared not go home for fear of her father's anger and the cold there. Desperate, she struck a match to warm her fingers. The flame brought visions of warmth and comfort: a large iron stove, a sumptuous feast, and a magnificent Christmas tree. Each vision vanished as the match burned out. When she struck another match, she saw her beloved, deceased grandmother. Desperate to stay with her, the girl lit all the matches, creating a blaze that seemed brighter than daylight. Her grandmother took her in her arms, and they ascended to a place free from cold, hunger, and pain. The next morning, the girl was found frozen to death, still holding the burnt matches. People assumed she had tried to warm herself, unaware of the beautiful visions and the peace she had found with her grandmother in her final moments."
