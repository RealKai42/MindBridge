All he thought about was himself.\n‍\n“I am so wonderful!” he would say. “Look at my wonderful eyebrows! Look at my excellent moustache! I look marvellous!”\n‍\nThe emperor loved to wear fancy clothes. He had four-hundred fancy shirts, three-hundred pairs of fancy pants, and one-thousand pairs of fancy socks.\n\nThe emperor also loved to say fancy words, like: ‘empirical’,  ‘cantankerous’, and ‘discombobulate’.\n‍\n(He didn’t know what the fancy words meant, but he liked to say them anyway. He liked to sound intelligent.)\n‍\n“I am so INTELLIGENT!” he said. “I am a GENIUS!”\n\nOne day, a man arrived at the palace. He said that he was a tailor. He said he could make the fanciest clothes in the land.\n\n(But really, this man was a dishonest man. He earned his money by fooling rich people.)\n‍\nThe tailor brought the emperor ten suitcases.\n‍\n“Your most majestic and intelligent majesty...” he said. “... I am here to show you my marvellous new discovery...\n\n“Everybody knows that you are the most intelligent man in the world. And I have created some amazing new clothes. These clothes are only for intelligent people. In fact, stupid people cannot even see these clothes...”\n\nThe emperor clapped his hands. “Amazing! With these clothes I can know who is smart and who is stupid! I will never be bothered by idiots again! Let me try these clothes!”\n\n‍\n\nThe tailor undressed the emperor until he stood only in his underpants. He unpacked his tape measure. He measured the emperor’s arms, legs, shoulders, and all around his big round belly.  \n‍\nThe tailor reached inside one of the suitcases.\n‍\n“No... this one is too big. No… this one is too small. Ahh! This one is perfect!”\n‍\nHe pretended to lift a shirt out of the suitcase.\n‍\n“What do you think?” said the tailor.\n\nThe emperor gasped. He could not see anything!\n‍\n“Isn’t it wonderful?” said the tailor. “And remember… only intelligent people will be able to see it!”\n‍\nThe tailor reached into his suitcase again. “Look at these pants! Aren’t they beautiful? And they are completely invisible to idiots! And look at this jacket! See the colours? A complete nincompoop will see absolutely nothing!”\n‍\n“Oh, oh, yes… very nice!” stammered the emperor. But he was confused. Why couldn’t he see the clothes?\n‍\n“Surely it’s not possible that I am an idiot?!” he thought. “A complete moron would not know fancy words like… vestibule! Crepuscular! Flibbertigibbit!”  \n‍\nBut the emperor said nothing.\n‍\nThe tailor pretended to dress the emperor in the invisible shirt, pants, jacket, and shoes.\n‍\nThe emperor stood in front of his mirror. He wanted to see the clothes, but all he saw was his big, round belly and his underpants.\n‍\n“I’m not sure that it’s really my style…” said the emperor. “But let me get a second opinion.”\n‍\nThe emperor called three of his most intelligent friends into the room.\n\n“Friends! What do you think of these new clothes? Only intelligent people can see these clothes. Stupid people see nothing at all!”\n‍\nOf course, his friends didn’t see anything either. But they did not want to look stupid.\n‍\n“Oh, yes! That is a great shirt!” said the first friend.\n“Yes! The pants are the perfect color,” said the second friend.\n“Cool shoes!” said the third friend.\n‍\nThe emperor was excited. “I will wear these new clothes in the parade tomorrow!”  \n‍\nThe emperor gave the tailor a lot of money. The tailor left the palace with ten suitcases full of gold. When he was safely in his carriage, he laughed long and hard.\n‍\n“What a doofus!”\n\nThat night, the Emperor did not sleep. He stayed up late, reading the biggest, heaviest books in his library.\n‍\n“I just need a few more fancy words, THEN I’ll be able to see my clothes,” he thought.\n\nIn the morning, two servants came to the Emperor's room to dress him for the parade.\n\nOf course, they couldn’t see any clothes either. But they said nothing. They did not want to look stupid.\n‍\nThey pretended to dress the emperor in invisible pants, invisible shirt, invisible jacket, and an invisible hat.\n\nThe emperor looked at himself in the mirror. He stared and he squinted. He turned his head left and right.\n\nAnd … wait… there it was!\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw a slight shimmering fabric. A checkered pattern. A tiny bit of colour. He could see the clothes!\n‍\n(In reality, there were no clothes. But we often see what we want to see.)\nThe emperor was happy that he could finally see the clothes.\n‍\n“Let’s join the parade!” he shouted.\n\nEverybody from the town was at the parade. All the intelligent people were there. All the scientists. All the writers. All the teachers. And all the children.\n‍\nThe emperor stood in his open carriage and waved to the crowd. But as the emperor’s carriage drove down the street, the crowd fell silent. The music stopped. Everybody stared at the emperor.\n‍\n“These clothes must be amazing...” thought the emperor.\n‍\nBut then, from the back of the crowd, a small child yelled:\n“Mummy, I can see his underpants!”\n‍\nEverybody gasped. Then there were a few giggles. And then everyone on the street laughed — and laughed — and laughed even harder.\n\nThey clapped and shouted: “UN-DER-PANTS! UN-DER-PANTS!”\n\n‍The emperor heard the crowd laugh. He knew he had been fooled. He wasn’t wearing special clothes. He was wearing nothing—only his underpants.\n‍\nHe jumped out of the carriage and ran all the way back to the palace. Behind him, he heard: “UN-DER-PANTS! UN-DER-PANTS!”\n‍\nHe ran to his bedroom and slammed the door.\n‍\nLater, when his friends found him, he was lying on his bed. He was wearing all his real clothes: all his fancy shirts, all his fancy pants, and all one-thousand pairs of fancy socks.",

He loved to show off his wealth and intelligence, and he was always looking for new ways to impress his subjects.\n\nOne day, two swindlers came to the emperor's court. They claimed to be weavers of the finest cloth in the world. They told the emperor, “Everybody knows that you are the most intelligent man in the world. And we have created some amazing new clothes. These clothes are only for intelligent people. In fact, stupid people cannot even see them.”\n\nThe emperor was intrigued. He thought to himself, \"If I wear these clothes, everyone will know how intelligent I am.\" So, he ordered the swindlers to make him a set of these special clothes.\n\nThe swindlers pretended to work on the clothes day and night. They set up looms and pretended to weave, but in reality, they were doing nothing at all. They asked for the finest silk and the purest gold thread, which they pocketed for themselves.\n\nAfter some time, the swindlers announced that the clothes were ready. They pretended to hold up the invisible garments and said, “Here are your new clothes, Your Majesty. Aren’t they beautiful?”\n\nThe emperor squinted and strained his eyes, but he could see nothing. However, he did not want to appear stupid, so he exclaimed, “Yes, they are indeed beautiful! I can see the fine colors and the intricate patterns.”\n\nHis ministers and courtiers, not wanting to appear stupid either, all agreed enthusiastically. “Yes, Your Majesty, these are the most magnificent clothes we have ever seen!”\n\nThe swindlers then pretended to dress the emperor in the invisible clothes. They fussed and fidgeted, making sure everything was just right. The emperor stood in front of a mirror, admiring himself in his non-existent outfit.\n\nThe next day, the emperor decided to show off his new clothes in a grand parade. He marched through the streets, proudly displaying his invisible garments. The townspeople, having heard about the special clothes, did not want to appear stupid either. So, they all cheered and praised the emperor’s new clothes.\n\n“Look at the emperor’s new clothes! Aren’t they wonderful?” they shouted.\n\nHowever, there was one small child who had not heard about the special clothes. As the emperor passed by, the child exclaimed, “But he isn’t wearing any clothes at all!”\n\nThe crowd fell silent. They began to murmur and whisper, realizing the truth. The emperor, too, realized that he had been fooled. But he was too proud to admit it. He continued to march in the parade, holding his head high, even though he was completely naked.\n\n(In reality, there were no clothes. But we often see what we want to see.)\n\nThe emperor was happy that he could finally see the clothes, or so he convinced himself. He shouted, “Let’s join the parade!” and continued to walk, pretending that nothing was amiss.\n\nAnd so, the emperor learned a valuable lesson about vanity and pride, though he never admitted it to anyone. The swindlers, meanwhile, had long since disappeared with their ill-gotten gains, leaving the emperor to face the consequences of his foolishness.",
