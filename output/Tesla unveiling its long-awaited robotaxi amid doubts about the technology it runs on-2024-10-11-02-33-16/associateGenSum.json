    "content": "DETROIT -- Expectations are high for the long-awaited unveiling of Tesla's robotaxi at a Hollywood studio Thursday night. Too high for some analysts and investors.\n\nThe company, which began selling software it calls “Full Self-Driving” nine years ago that still can't drive itself, is expected to show off the so-called “Cybercab” vehicle, which may not have a steering wheel and pedals.\n\nThe unveiling comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to persuade investors that his company is more about artificial intelligence and robotics as it struggles to sell its core products, an aging lineup of electric vehicles.\n\nSome analysts are predicting that it will be a historic day for the Austin, Texas, company as it takes a huge step toward a long-awaited robotaxi service powered by AI.\n\nBut others who track self-driving vehicles say Musk has yet to demonstrate Tesla's system can travel safely without a human driver ready to step in to prevent crashes.\n\n“I don't know why the headlines continue to be ‘What will Tesla announce?’ rather than ‘Why does Tesla think we’re so stupid?'” said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies autonomous vehicles.\n\nHe doesn't see Tesla having the ability to show off software and hardware that can work without human supervision, even in a limited area that's well-known to the driving system.\n\n“We just haven't seen any indication that that is what Tesla is working toward,” Walker Smith said. “If they were, they would be showcasing this not on a closed lot, but in an actual city or on an actual freeway.”\n\nWithout a clear breakthrough in autonomous technology, Tesla will just show off a vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel, which already has been done by numerous other companies, he said.\n\n“The challenge is developing a combination of hardware and software plus the human and digital infrastructure to actually safely drive a vehicle even without a steering wheel on public roads in any conditions,” Walker Smith said. “Tesla has been giving us that demo every year, and it's not reassuring us.”\n\nMany industry analysts aren't expecting much from the event either. While TD Cowen's Jeff Osborne expects Musk to reveal the Cybercab and perhaps the Model 2, a lower-cost electric vehicle, he said he doesn't expect much of a change on self-driving technology.\n\n“We expect the event to be light on details and appeal to the true long-term believers in Tesla,” Osborne wrote in a note. Musk's claims on the readiness of Full Self Driving, though, will be crucial “given past delays and ongoing scrutiny” of the system and of Tesla's less-sophisticated Autopilot driver-assist software.\n\nTesla's model lineup is struggling and isn't likely to be refreshed until late next year at the earliest, Osborne wrote. Plus, he wrote that in TD Cowen's view the “politicization of Elon” is tarnishing the Tesla brand among Democrat buyers in the U.S.\n\nMusk has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and has pushed many conservative causes. Last weekend he joined Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMusk has been saying for more than five years that a fleet of robotaxis is near, allowing Tesla owners to make money by having their cars carry passengers while they're not in use by the owners.\n\nBut he has acknowledged that past predictions for the use of autonomous driving proved too optimistic. In 2019, he promised the fleet of autonomous vehicles by the end of 2020.\n\nHowever, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who is bullish on Tesla stock, wrote in an investor note that robotaxi event, dubbed “We, Robot,” by the company, will be a new chapter of growth for Tesla.\n\nIves expects many updates and details from Tesla on the robotaxi, plus breakthroughs in Full Self Driving and artificial intelligence. He also is looking for a phased-in strategy for rolling out the robotaxis within the next year, as well as a Tesla ride-sharing app, and demonstrations of technology “designed to revolutionize urban transportation.”\n\nIves, whose organization will attend the invitation-only event at the Warner Bros. studio, wrote that he also expects updates on Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, which the company plans to start selling in 2026.\n\n“We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi R&D shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk & Co. lay out the company’s vision for the future,” Ives wrote.\n\nThe announcement comes as U.S. safety regulators are investigating Full Self Driving and Autopilot based on evidence that it has a weak system for making sure human drivers pay attention.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration forced Tesla to recall Full Self-Driving in February because it allowed speeding and violated other traffic laws, especially near intersections. Tesla was to fix the problems with an online software update.\n\nLast April in Snohomish County, Washington, near Seattle, a Tesla using Full Self-Driving hit and killed a motorcyclist, authorities said. The Tesla driver told authorities that he was using the system while looking at his phone when the car rear-ended the motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.\n\nNHTSA says it's evaluating information on the fatal crash from Tesla and law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department also has sought information from Tesla about Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, as well as other items.\n\n",

Too high for some analysts and investors.\n\n“I don't know why the headlines continue to be ‘What will Tesla announce?’ rather than ‘Why does Tesla think we’re so stupid?'” said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who specializes in autonomous vehicle regulations. “The company has a history of making grand promises that it struggles to keep, and this robotaxi announcement feels like more of the same.”\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has been known for his ambitious goals and bold statements, often setting the bar high for his company's technological advancements. The robotaxi, which is expected to be a fully autonomous vehicle capable of operating without a driver, is no exception. However, skepticism remains about whether Tesla can deliver on its promises, especially given the complexities and regulatory hurdles associated with self-driving technology.\n\n“It's one thing to show a prototype in a controlled environment, but it's another to have a fully functional, safe, and reliable vehicle without a steering wheel on public roads in any conditions,” Walker Smith said. “Tesla has been giving us that demo every year, and it's not reassuring us.”\n\nThe skepticism is not unfounded. Tesla has faced numerous challenges and controversies over the years, from production delays to safety concerns. The company's Autopilot system, which offers semi-autonomous driving capabilities, has been involved in several high-profile accidents, raising questions about the readiness of fully autonomous technology.\n\nAdding to the controversy, Musk has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and has pushed many conservative causes. Last weekend he joined Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, a move that has polarized public opinion and drawn criticism from some quarters.\n\nDespite the doubts and political distractions, Tesla remains a leader in the electric vehicle market, and its innovations continue to capture the public's imagination. The robotaxi, if successful, could revolutionize transportation by reducing the need for personal car ownership and lowering transportation costs.\n\nThe company has also announced plans to develop a humanoid robot, which the company plans to start selling in 2026. This robot, dubbed \"Tesla Bot,\" is designed to perform repetitive and dangerous tasks, potentially transforming industries such as manufacturing and logistics.\n\nAs the world watches the unveiling of the robotaxi, the question remains whether Tesla can turn its ambitious vision into reality. For now, the excitement and skepticism coexist, reflecting the high stakes and high expectations that have come to define Tesla's journey.",
