| 8027 | Ratan Tata, the philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Group, who passed away at 86, was pivotal in globalising and modernising one of India’s oldest business houses. His bold business risks led to high-profile acquisitions, keeping the 155-year-old conglomerate relevant post-India's economic liberalisation in the 1990s. Notable acquisitions included Tetley Tea, Corus, and Jaguar Land Rover, symbolising a former colony's business taking over British assets. Tata's global vision was supported by centralising operations and appointing international executives. He established the Group Corporate Centre to provide strategic direction and support for mergers and acquisitions, significantly enhancing Tata Motors' global perception. Despite successes, the Tata Nano project failed due to misreading the Indian market, and succession issues arose post-retirement in 2012, notably with Cyrus Mistry's ousting. Nevertheless, Tata left the group stronger, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) becoming India's largest IT services company and a major revenue contributor. The Tata Group also reacquired Air India, fulfilling Tata's dream. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India's industrial policy favors large conglomerates like Tata, positioning them to benefit from rapid economic growth across priority sectors. |

| 8027 | 836 | Ratan Tata, the philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Group who has died aged 86, played a crucial role in globalising and modernising one of India’s oldest business houses. He began centralising the increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by removing a series of 'satraps' at Tata Steel, Tata Motors, and other companies. His leadership saw Tata Motors making significant acquisitions, signaling that Indian corporates had 'arrived' on the global stage amid rising growth rates and liberalisation. A notable event during his tenure was the ousting of Cyrus Mistry as Tata chairman in 2016, which led to a prolonged legal battle that the Tatas eventually won. |

| 8027 | 836 | Ratan Tata, the philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Group who has died aged 86, played an instrumental role in globalising and modernising one of India’s oldest business houses. He began centralising increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by showing the door to a string of 'satraps' (a Persian term meaning an imperial governor) at Tata Steel, Tata Motors and other companies within the group. Under his leadership, Tata Group made significant acquisitions, including the purchase of Tetley Tea, Corus Steel, and Jaguar Land Rover, which marked the arrival of Indian corporates on the global stage. These moves coincided with India's economic liberalisation and rapid growth rates. Ratan Tata's tenure was not without controversy; in 2016, his successor Cyrus Mistry was ousted as Tata chairman following a boardroom coup, leading to a protracted legal battle that the Tatas eventually won. Despite these challenges, Ratan Tata is remembered for his modesty, visionary leadership, and significant contributions to both the Tata Group and Indian industry at large. His legacy includes not only the global expansion of the Tata Group but also his philanthropic efforts, which have had a lasting impact on various sectors in India. |
