A poor little girl, without a hat or shoes, wandered through the streets, shivering from the cold and hunger. Her long, fair hair was covered in snowflakes, and she looked utterly miserable. As she walked, she saw lights in the windows of houses, but she had no place to go. To warm her hands, she lit a match, which sputtered and burned brightly, giving off a strange light.

| 5017 | 938 | It was a bitterly cold evening, the last of the year, and a poor little girl, barefoot and bareheaded, wandered the streets trying to sell matches. Despite her efforts, she hadn't sold any and was shivering with cold and hunger. She found a corner between two houses to sit and huddle for warmth, but she grew colder and dared not go home for fear of her father's anger and the cold there. Desperate, she struck a match to warm her fingers. The flame brought visions of warmth and comfort: a large iron stove, a sumptuous feast, and a magnificent Christmas tree. Each vision vanished as the match burned out. When she struck another match, she saw her beloved, deceased grandmother. Desperate to stay with her, the girl lit all the matches, creating a blaze that seemed brighter than daylight. Her grandmother took her in her arms, and they ascended to a place free from cold, hunger, and pain. The next morning, the girl was found frozen to death, still holding the burnt matches. People assumed she had tried to warm herself, unaware of the beautiful visions and the peace she had found with her grandmother in her final moments. |
