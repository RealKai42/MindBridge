| 8027 | Ratan Tata, the philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Group, who passed away at 86, was pivotal in globalising and modernising one of India’s oldest business houses. His bold business risks led to high-profile acquisitions, keeping the 155-year-old conglomerate relevant post-India's economic liberalisation in the 1990s. Notable acquisitions included Tetley Tea, Corus, and Jaguar Land Rover, symbolising a reversal of colonial economic dynamics. Despite some setbacks, such as the costly Corus acquisition and the failure of the Tata Nano, Tata's vision for global expansion was transformative. He centralised operations, appointed international executives, and established the Group Corporate Centre to provide strategic direction. His leadership saw Tata Group's revenues increasingly come from outside India, with significant contributions from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Jaguar Land Rover. Tata's tenure also faced challenges, including a succession dispute with Cyrus Mistry. Despite these issues, Tata left the group in a stronger position, both domestically and globally. His legacy includes modernising the group with a focus on IT and making bold acquisitions. Under India's current industrial policy, the Tata Group is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. |

| 8027 | 836 | Ratan Tata, the philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Group who has died aged 86, played a crucial role in globalising and modernising one of India’s oldest business houses. He began centralising the increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by removing a series of 'satraps' at Tata Steel, Tata Motors, and other companies. His strategic acquisitions, including the notable deal by Tata Motors, signaled that Indian corporates had 'arrived' on the global stage, coinciding with rising growth rates and economic liberalisation. The tenure of his successor, Cyrus Mistry, was marked by turbulence; Mistry was ousted as Tata chairman in 2016 following a boardroom coup, leading to a prolonged legal battle which the Tatas eventually won. Mistry later died in a car crash in 2022. |
