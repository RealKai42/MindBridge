Her warmth and kindness touched the hearts of millions, and her tireless work for charitable causes brought hope and comfort to those in need.\n\nToday, as we gather to remember her, we are reminded of the profound impact she had on so many lives.

Your absence leaves a void that can never be filled, and we struggle to come to terms with the loss of someone so irreplaceable. Your sons, William and Harry, have shown remarkable strength and resilience in the face of this tragedy, and we are committed to steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned.\n\nWe want you to know that your spirit lives on in the hearts of those who loved you and in the countless lives you touched. Your legacy of compassion and kindness will continue to inspire us all to strive for a better, more caring world. Though you are no longer with us, your light will never fade, and your memory will forever be cherished.\n\nOn behalf of the family, I want to express our deepest gratitude for the outpouring of love and support we have received from around the globe.
