All he thought about was himself.\n‍\n“I am so wonderful!” he would say. “Look at my wonderful eyebrows! Look at my excellent moustache! I look marvellous!”\n‍\nThe emperor loved to wear fancy clothes. He had four-hundred fancy shirts, three-hundred pairs of fancy pants, and one-thousand pairs of fancy socks.\n\nThe emperor also loved to say fancy words, like: ‘empirical’,  ‘cantankerous’, and ‘discombobulate’.\n‍\n(He didn’t know what the fancy words meant, but he liked to say them anyway. He liked to sound intelligent.)\n‍\n“I am so INTELLIGENT!” he said. “I am a GENIUS!”\n\nOne day, a man arrived at the palace. He said that he was a tailor. He said he could make the fanciest clothes in the land.\n\n(But really, this man was a dishonest man. He earned his money by fooling rich people.)\n‍\nThe tailor brought the emperor ten suitcases.\n‍\n“Your most majestic and intelligent majesty...” he said. “... I am here to show you my marvellous new discovery...\n\n“Everybody knows that you are the most intelligent man in the world. And I have created some amazing new clothes. These clothes are only for intelligent people. In fact, stupid people cannot even see these clothes...”\n\nThe emperor clapped his hands. “Amazing! With these clothes I can know who is smart and who is stupid! I will never be bothered by idiots again! Let me try these clothes!”\n\n‍\n\nThe tailor undressed the emperor until he stood only in his underpants. He unpacked his tape measure. He measured the emperor’s arms, legs, shoulders, and all around his big round belly.  \n‍\nThe tailor reached inside one of the suitcases.\n‍\n“No... this one is too big. No… this one is too small. Ahh! This one is perfect!”\n‍\nHe pretended to lift a shirt out of the suitcase.\n‍\n“What do you think?” said the tailor.\n\nThe emperor gasped. He could not see anything!\n‍\n“Isn’t it wonderful?” said the tailor. “And remember… only intelligent people will be able to see it!”\n‍\nThe tailor reached into his suitcase again. “Look at these pants! Aren’t they beautiful? And they are completely invisible to idiots! And look at this jacket! See the colours? A complete nincompoop will see absolutely nothing!”\n‍\n“Oh, oh, yes… very nice!” stammered the emperor. But he was confused. Why couldn’t he see the clothes?\n‍\n“Surely it’s not possible that I am an idiot?!” he thought. “A complete moron would not know fancy words like… vestibule! Crepuscular! Flibbertigibbit!”  \n‍\nBut the emperor said nothing.\n‍\nThe tailor pretended to dress the emperor in the invisible shirt, pants, jacket, and shoes.\n‍\nThe emperor stood in front of his mirror. He wanted to see the clothes, but all he saw was his big, round belly and his underpants.\n‍\n“I’m not sure that it’s really my style…” said the emperor. “But let me get a second opinion.”\n‍\nThe emperor called three of his most intelligent friends into the room.\n\n“Friends! What do you think of these new clothes? Only intelligent people can see these clothes. Stupid people see nothing at all!”\n‍\nOf course, his friends didn’t see anything either. But they did not want to look stupid.\n‍\n“Oh, yes! That is a great shirt!” said the first friend.\n“Yes! The pants are the perfect color,” said the second friend.\n“Cool shoes!” said the third friend.\n‍\nThe emperor was excited. “I will wear these new clothes in the parade tomorrow!”  \n‍\nThe emperor gave the tailor a lot of money. The tailor left the palace with ten suitcases full of gold. When he was safely in his carriage, he laughed long and hard.\n‍\n“What a doofus!”\n\nThat night, the Emperor did not sleep. He stayed up late, reading the biggest, heaviest books in his library.\n‍\n“I just need a few more fancy words, THEN I’ll be able to see my clothes,” he thought.\n\nIn the morning, two servants came to the Emperor's room to dress him for the parade.\n\nOf course, they couldn’t see any clothes either. But they said nothing. They did not want to look stupid.\n‍\nThey pretended to dress the emperor in invisible pants, invisible shirt, invisible jacket, and an invisible hat.\n\nThe emperor looked at himself in the mirror. He stared and he squinted. He turned his head left and right.\n\nAnd … wait… there it was!\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw a slight shimmering fabric. A checkered pattern. A tiny bit of colour. He could see the clothes!\n‍\n(In reality, there were no clothes. But we often see what we want to see.)\nThe emperor was happy that he could finally see the clothes.\n‍\n“Let’s join the parade!” he shouted.\n\nEverybody from the town was at the parade. All the intelligent people were there. All the scientists. All the writers. All the teachers. And all the children.\n‍\nThe emperor stood in his open carriage and waved to the crowd. But as the emperor’s carriage drove down the street, the crowd fell silent. The music stopped. Everybody stared at the emperor.\n‍\n“These clothes must be amazing...” thought the emperor.\n‍\nBut then, from the back of the crowd, a small child yelled:\n“Mummy, I can see his underpants!”\n‍\nEverybody gasped. Then there were a few giggles. And then everyone on the street laughed — and laughed — and laughed even harder.\n\nThey clapped and shouted: “UN-DER-PANTS! UN-DER-PANTS!”\n\n‍The emperor heard the crowd laugh. He knew he had been fooled. He wasn’t wearing special clothes. He was wearing nothing—only his underpants.\n‍\nHe jumped out of the carriage and ran all the way back to the palace. Behind him, he heard: “UN-DER-PANTS! UN-DER-PANTS!”\n‍\nHe ran to his bedroom and slammed the door.\n‍\nLater, when his friends found him, he was lying on his bed. He was wearing all his real clothes: all his fancy shirts, all his fancy pants, and all one-thousand pairs of fancy socks.",

    "summary": "Once upon a time, there was a vain emperor with a big round belly, bushy eyebrows, and a long moustache. He loved fancy clothes and often boasted about his intelligence, using words he didn't understand. One day, a dishonest tailor arrived, claiming to make clothes visible only to intelligent people. The emperor, eager to prove his intelligence, pretended to see the invisible clothes the tailor \"made\" for him. The emperor's friends, not wanting to appear stupid, also pretended to see the clothes. Excited, the emperor decided to wear the invisible clothes in a parade. The tailor left with a fortune in gold, laughing at the emperor's gullibility.\n\nDuring the parade, the townspeople, including scientists, writers, teachers, and children, were silent and confused. A child finally shouted that the emperor was in his underpants, causing the crowd to erupt in laughter. Realizing he had been fooled, the emperor ran back to his palace in embarrassment. He locked himself in his room, wearing all his real clothes, including his fancy shirts, pants, and one-thousand pairs of socks, to hide his shame."
