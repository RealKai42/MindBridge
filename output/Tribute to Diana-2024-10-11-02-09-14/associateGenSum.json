All over the world she was a symbol of selfless humanity, someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who proved in the most extraordinary way that she cared. She was a princess who touched the lives of millions, a beacon of hope for those who felt unheard, and a source of comfort for those in need.\n\nHer ability to connect with people from all walks of life, her tireless charity work, and her unwavering dedication to her children made her a unique and irreplaceable figure.

The void you have left is immense, and the pain of your absence is felt deeply by all who knew and loved you. Your sons, William and Harry, are testament to your love and guidance. They are exceptional young men who carry forward your spirit and values. We are committed to steering them so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned.\n\nIn the face of this tragedy, we must also address the baffling and relentless scrutiny that Diana faced from the media.
