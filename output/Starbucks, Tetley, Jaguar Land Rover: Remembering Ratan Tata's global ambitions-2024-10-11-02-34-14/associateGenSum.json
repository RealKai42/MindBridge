The iconic British brand was three times the size of the small Tata group company that had bought it.\n\nIn subsequent years, his ambitions grew only bigger, as his group swallowed up major British industrial giants like the steelmaker Corus and the luxury car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover.\n\nWhile the acquisitions didn’t always pay off - Corus was bought at very expensive valuations just before the global financial crisis of 2007, and remained a drag on Tata Steel’s performance for years - they were big power moves.\n\nThey also had a great symbolic effect, says Mircea Raianu, historian and author of Tata: The Global Corporation That Built Indian Capitalism. He adds that they “represented 'the empire striking back' as a business from a former colony took over the motherland's prize assets, reversing the sneering attitude with which British industrialists looked upon the Tata Group a century earlier”.\n\nObituary: Ratan Tata, the 'modest' Indian tycoon\nIndia's Ratan Tata: in his own words\nGetty Images The blast furnaces, that are scheduled to be closed, at the Port Talbot Steelworks, operated by Tata Steel Ltd., beyond the River Afan in Port Talbot, UK, on Tuesday, June 25, 2024. Getty Images\nTata operates across 100 countries, including owning the UK’s largest steelworks at Port Talbot\nGlobal ambitions\nThe Tata Group’s outlook had been “outward-oriented” from the very beginning, according to Andrea Goldstein, an economist who published a study in 2008 on the internationalisation of Indian companies, with a particular focus on Tata.\n\nAs early as in the 1950s, Tata companies operated with foreign partners.\n\nBut Ratan Tata was keen to “internationalise in giant strides, not in token, incremental steps”, Ms Goldstein pointed out.\n\nHis unconventional education in architecture and a ring side view of his family group companies may have played a part in the way he thought about expansion, says Mr Raianu. But it was the “structural transformation of the group” he steered, that allowed him to execute his vision for a global footprint.\n\nTata had to fight an exceptional corporate battle at Bombay House, the group headquarters, when he took over as the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991 - an appointment that coincided with India’s decision to open up its economy.\n\nHe began centralising increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by showing the door to a string of 'satraps' (a Persian term meaning an imperial governor) at Tata Steel, Tata Motors and the Taj Group of Hotels who ran operations with little corporate oversight from the holding company.\n\nDoing this allowed him not only to surround himself with people who could help him execute his global vision, but also prevent the Tata Group - protected thus far from foreign competition - from fading into irrelevance as India opened up.\n\nAt both Tata Sons, the holding company, as well as individual groups within it, he appointed foreigners, non-resident Indians and executives with contacts and networks across the world in the management team.\n\nHe also set up the Group Corporate Centre (GCC) to provide strategic direction to group companies. It provided “M&A [mergers and acquisitions] advisory support, helped the group companies to mobilise capital and assessed whether the target company would fit into the Tata's values”, researchers at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore wrote in a 2016 paper.\n\nThe GCC also helped Tata Motors raise money for high-profile buyouts like Jaguar Land Rover which dramatically changed the global perception of a company that was essentially a tractor manufacturer.\n\n“The JLR takeover was widely seen as 'revenge' on Ford, which had derisively refused to acquire Tata Motors in the early 90s and then was beaten to the punch on the deal by Tata Motors. Taken together, these acquisitions suggested that Indian corporates had 'arrived' on the global stage just as growth rates were picking up and the liberalising reforms bearing fruit,” says Mr Raianu.\n\nToday, the $128bn group operates across 100 countries with a substantial portion of its total revenues coming from outside India.\n\nGetty Images Tata Sons Chairman - Ratan Tata poses alongside the Tata Nano at its launch in Mumbai on Monday.Getty Images\nThe Tata Nano, billed as the world's cheapest car, was a flop\nThe misses\nWhile the Tata Group made significant strides overseas in the early 2000s, domestically the failure of the Tata Nano – launched and marketed as the world’s cheapest car – was a setback for Tata.\n\nThis was his most ambitious project, but he had clearly misread India’s consumer market this time.\n\nBrand experts say an aspirational India didn’t want to associate with the cheap car tag. And Tata himself eventually admitted that the \"poor man's car\" tag was a \"stigma\" that needed to be undone.\n\nHe believed there could be a resurrection of his product, but the Tata Nano was eventually discontinued after sales plummeted year on year.\n\nSuccession at the Tata Group also became a thorny issue.\n\nMr Tata remained far too involved in running the conglomerate after his retirement in 2012, through the \"backdoor\" of the Tata Trust which owns two-thirds of the stock holding of Tata Sons, the holding company, say experts.\n\n“Without assigning Ratan Tata blame for it, his involvement in the succession dispute with [Cyrus] Mistry undoubtedly tarnished the image of the group,” says Mr Rainu.\n\nMistry, who died in a car crash in 2022 was ousted as Tata chairman in 2016 following a boardroom coup that sparked a long-running legal battle which the Tatas eventually won.\n\nGetty Images Ratan Tata, Chairman Tata Group, at Jaguar Pavilion during 11th Auto Expo held at Pragati Maidan on January 5, 2012 in New Delhi, India.

This was a dream come true for Ratan Tata, a trained pilot himself, but also a bold bet given how capital intensive it is to run an airline.\n\nBut the Tatas seem to be in a stronger position than ever before to take big bold bets on everything from airlines to semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIndia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to have clearly adopted an industrial policy of creating \"national champions\" whereby a few large conglomerates are built up and promoted in order to achieve rapid economic outcomes that extend across priority sectors.\n\nAlong with newer industrial groups like Adani, the decks are clearly stacked in favour of the Tata Group to benefit from this.",

His leadership not only transformed the Tata Group into a global powerhouse but also left an indelible mark on the Indian corporate landscape.\n\n**India's Ratan Tata: in his own words**\n\nRatan Tata was known for his modesty and humility, traits that were reflected in his leadership style. He often spoke about the importance of ethical business practices and the need to give back to society. His words and actions inspired many in the business community and beyond.\n\n**Centralising Operations and Modernisation**\n\nHe began centralising increasingly decentralised, domestic-focused operations by showing the door to a string of 'satraps' (a Persian term meaning an imperial governor) at Tata Steel, Tata Motors, and other key companies within the group. This move was part of his broader strategy to streamline operations and improve efficiency across the conglomerate.\n\n**Global Acquisitions and Expansion**\n\nUnder his leadership, Tata Group made several high-profile acquisitions that signaled its arrival on the global stage. Notable among these were the acquisition of Tetley Tea by Tata Tea, the purchase of Corus by Tata Steel, and the acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover by Tata Motors. These deals not only expanded Tata Group's global footprint but also showcased the growing prowess of Indian corporates in the international arena.\n\n**Challenges and Controversies**\n\nRatan Tata's tenure was not without its challenges. One of the most significant controversies was the ousting of his successor, Cyrus Mistry, who died in a car crash in 2022. Mistry was removed as Tata chairman in 2016 following a boardroom coup that sparked a long-running legal battle. The Tatas eventually won the legal battle, but the episode highlighted the complexities and internal conflicts within the conglomerate.\n\n**Philanthropy and Legacy**\n\nBeyond business, Ratan Tata was deeply committed to philanthropy. Under his leadership, the Tata Trusts, which control a significant portion of Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, continued to support numerous social causes, including education, healthcare, and rural development. His philanthropic efforts earned him widespread respect and admiration.\n\nRatan Tata's legacy is one of transformation and modernisation. He took a traditional, family-owned business and turned it into a global conglomerate while maintaining a strong commitment to ethical practices and social responsibility.
